# swimTime
Requirements:
- docker
- docker- compose
- maven

This repository basically do the same thing as the SwimCheck android app do but as microservice architecture because i had the idea of doing multi platform app with a backend.
Since [aquatime](https://aquatime.it/) change everything by requesting money this software **DON'T** work anymore.
I will not delete the repository itself because I think it's a good XPath software example.
